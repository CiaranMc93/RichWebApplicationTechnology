					<h2>The Heritage Golf and Spa Resort</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Ciaran was a green keeper for the golf course as part of a
					dedicated team. This line of work has thought him to be disciplined
					and work hard for a large five star resort. Duties included green
					mowing,cutting and cleaning. Sanding the bunkers was a duty
					involved also. Work started at six in the morning in order to avoid
					the morning golfers. Because it is a five star resort we needed to
					behave and look respectable while doing a good job on the course
					because it was a world renowned course.</p>

					<h2>Portlaoise Mails Center</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Ciaran worked for An Post as part of the Christmas Casual
					initiative. This gave people a chance to earn money while gaining
					experience as a mail sorter at a busy An Post mailing center.
					Portlaoise is one of the main centers in Ireland that has port run
					through it so the attantion to detail is important in this job. It
					required late hours as shipments would arrive from far away to be
					sorted and sent off for the public to receive.</p>
