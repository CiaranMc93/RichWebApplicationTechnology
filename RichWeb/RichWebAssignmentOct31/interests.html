				<div class="gaa" id="gaa">
					<p>Ciaran has a great affinity with GAA. He enjoys playing it
						and supporting his local team, O'Dempseys, and his county team of
						Laois. He has won various titles in his time playing GAA such as
						two Lenister medals and multiple county championship and league
						medals. He supports his team with pride and is developing an
						application that will connect the GAA community better than ever
						before. The application will allow users to view scores of matches
						in real time. It will be easy to view scores even if you are in a
						different country and it will engage the interst of fans from
						around the world. Creating this app was of great fun to Ciaran as
						he wanted to create a way people can enjoy GAA more and more.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="soccer">
					<p>Ciaran has played soccer since he was ten which has allowed
						him to excel in the sport. He was part of the Kildare Kennedy Cup
						squad which is a very big Irish soccer tournament that is
						frequented by national scouts from around Ireland and England.
						This experience allowed him to be part of the u14 Irish
						international squad which was a very prpoud moment for him that he
						could represent his country and wear that famous green jersey. His
						favourite team is Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League. He has
						many jerseys and other items that reference 'Spurs'. He wishes
						some day to travel to London and watch a game at White Hart Lane
						where 'Spurs' play every week.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="music">
					<p>Ciaran loves music. He is very passionate about it. His
						favourite bands include the Foo Fighters, AC/DC, The Beetles and
						many many more. He has a diverse range of likes and dislikes but
						he enjoys many forms of music. He was in a band for a year and is
						able to play bass guitar. It was a passion of his that has been in
						the background while he has attended college.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="exercise">
					<p>Ciaran likes to exercise a lot as part of a balanced
						lifestyle. Computer science is not a very sporty course which
						means he needs to keep in shape. He enjoys running and going to
						the gym regularly and wishes to take part in triathalons and
						marathons in the future. He is very interested in the science
						behind sports and wishes to go into work along the line of sports
						softeare that can help improve the game. Helping GAA come into the
						21st Century and embrace technology is a goal of his in the
						future. After a serious knee injury in 2011 he was determined to
						come back stronger than ever and exercise helped him along the
						way.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="programming">
					<p>Ciaran enjoys programming a lot. He enjoys how mechanical it
						all is. There is no right way to write a program and it allows
						creativity even if it may be inefficient. There are many benefits
						to being a programmer and Ciaran has taken full advantage of his
						teachings. He is more creative in how he approaches anything in
						life and his problem solving ability has improved ten fold. He
						views problems in a different light than before he learned how to
						program. Ciarans favourite programming language is JAVA. He also
						enjoys all the front end programming that comes with CSS HTML5 and
						Javascript. He prefers the front end side of things but is not
						afraid to get his hands dirty and do some back end programming.
						Other languages he can use are C, C#, JSP, JSON and XML which are
						all mainly back end languages.</p>
