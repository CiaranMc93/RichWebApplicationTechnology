			<h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
			<p>Defeasible reasoning is a kind of reasoning that is based on
				reasons that are defeasible, as opposed to the indefeasible reasons
				of deductive logic. Defeasible reasoning is a particular kind of
				non-demonstrative reasoning, where the reasoning does not produce a
				full, complete, or final demonstration of a claim, i.e., where
				fallibility and corrigibility of a conclusion are acknowledged. In
				other words defeasible reasoning produces a contingent statement or
				claim. Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning are probabilistic
				reasoning, inductive reasoning, statistical reasoning, abductive
				reasoning, and paraconsistent reasoning. Defeasible reasoning is
				also a kind of ampliative reasoning because its conclusions reach
				beyond the pure meanings of the premises. The differences between
				these kinds of reasoning correspond to differences about the
				conditional that each kind of reasoning uses, and on what premise
				(or on what authority) the conditional is adopted:
			<ul>
				<li><i>Deductive</i> (from meaning postulate, axiom, or
					contingent assertion): if p then q (i.e., q or not-p)</li>
				<li><i>Defeasible</i> (from authority): if p then (defeasibly)
					q</li>
				<li><i>Probabilistic</i> (from combinatorics and indifference):
					if p then (probably) q</li>
				<li><i>Statistical</i> (from data and presumption): the
					frequency of qs among ps is high (or inference from a model fit to
					data); hence, (in the right context) if p then (probably) q</li>
				<li><i>Inductive</i> (theory formation; from data, coherence,
					simplicity, and confirmation): (inducibly) "if p then q"; hence, if
					p then (deducibly-but-revisably) q</li>
				<li><i>Abductive</i> (from data and theory): p and q are
					correlated, and q is sufficient for p; hence, if p then (abducibly)
					q as cause</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some have thought that defeasible reasoning could be connected
				to qualitative probabilistic reasoning, but such efforts have not
				borne great insights.</p>
			<p>Defeasible reasoning finds its fullest expression in
				jurisprudence, ethics and moral philosophy, epistemology, pragmatics
				and conversational conventions in linguistics, constructivist
				decision theories, and in knowledge representation and planning in
				artificial intelligence. It is also closely identified with prima
				facie (presumptive) reasoning (i.e., reasoning on the "face" of
				evidence), and ceteris paribus (default) reasoning (i.e., reasoning,
				all things "being equal").</p>

		<h1>History</h1>
		____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
		<p>
			Though Aristotle differentiated the forms of reasoning that are valid
			for logic and philosophy from the more general ones that are used in
			everyday life (see dialectics and rhetoric), 20th century
			philosophers mainly concentrated on deductive reasoning. At the end
			of the 19th century, logic texts would typically survey both
			demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning, often giving more
			space to the latter. However, after the blossoming of mathematical
			logic at the hands of Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead and
			Willard van Orman Quine, latter-20th century logic texts paid little
			attention to the non-deductive modes of inference.<br> <br>
			There are several notable exceptions. John Maynard Keynes wrote his
			dissertation on non-demonstrative reasoning, and influenced the
			thinking of Ludwig Wittgenstein on this subject. Wittgenstein, in
			turn, had many admirers, including the positivist legal scholar
			H.L.A. Hart and the speech act linguist John L. Austin, Stephen
			Toulmin in rhetoric (Chaim Perelman too), the moral theorists W.D.
			Ross and C.L. Stevenson, and the vagueness epistemologist/ontologist
			Friedrich Waismann.<br> <br> The etymology of defeasible
			usually refers to Middle English law of contracts, where a condition
			of defeasance is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or
			deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy, deprecate and derogate
			are often used in the same contexts as defeasible, the verbs annul
			and invalidate (and nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal,
			debar, void, cancel, countermand, preempt, etc.) are more properly
			correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words
			beginning with the letter d. Many dictionaries do contain the verb,
			to defease with past participle, defeased.<br> <br>
			Philosophers in moral theory and rhetoric had taken defeasibility
			largely for granted when American epistemologists rediscovered
			Wittgenstein's thinking on the subject: John Ladd, Roderick Chisholm,
			Roderick Firth, Ernest Sosa, Robert Nozick, and John L. Pollock all
			began writing with new conviction about how appearance as red was
			only a defeasible reason for believing something to be red. More
			importantly Wittgenstein's orientation toward language-games (and
			away from semantics) emboldened these epistemologists to manage
			rather than to expurgate prima facie logical inconsistency.<br>
			<br> At the same time (in the mid-1960s), two more students of
			Hart and Austin at Oxford, Brian Barry and David Gauthier, were
			applying defeasible reasoning to political argument and practical
			reasoning (of action), respectively. Joel Feinberg and Joseph Raz
			were beginning to produce equally mature works in ethics and
			jurisprudence informed by defeasibility.<br> By far the most
			significant works on defeasibility by the mid-1970s were in
			epistemology, where John Pollock's 1974 Knowledge and Justification
			popularized his terminology of undercutting and rebutting (which
			mirrored the analysis of Toulmin). Pollock's work was significant
			precisely because it brought defeasibility so close to philosophical
			logicians. The failure of logicians to dismiss defeasibility in
			epistemology (as Cambridge's logicians had done to Hart decades
			earlier) landed defeasible reasoning in the philosophical mainstream.<br>
			<br> Defeasibility had always been closely related to argument,
			rhetoric, and law, except in epistemology, where the chains of
			reasons, and the origin of reasons, were not often discussed.
			Nicholas Rescher's Dialectics is an example of how difficult it was
			for philosophers to contemplate more complex systems of defeasible
			reasoning. This was in part because proponents of informal logic
			became the keepers of argument and rhetoric while insisting that
			formalism was anathema to argument.<br> <br> About this
			time, researchers in artificial intelligence became interested in
			non-monotonic reasoning and its semantics. With philosophers such as
			Pollock and Donald Nute (e.g., defeasible logic), dozens of computer
			scientists and logicians produced complex systems of defeasible
			reasoning between 1980 and 2000. No single system of defeasible
			reasoning would emerge in the same way that Quine's system of logic
			became a de facto standard. Nevertheless, the 100-year headstart on
			non-demonstrative logical calculi, due to George Boole, Charles
			Sanders Peirce, and Gottlob Frege was being closed: both
			demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning now have formal
			calculi.<br> <br> There are related (and slightly
			competing) systems of reasoning that are newer than systems of
			defeasible reasoning, e.g., belief revision and dynamic logic. The
			dialogue logics of Charles Hamblin and Jim Mackenzie (logician), and
			their colleagues, can also be tied closely to defeasible reasoning.
			Belief revision is a non-constructive specification of the desiderata
			with which, or constraints according to which, epistemic change takes
			place. Dynamic logic is related mainly because, like paraconsistent
			logic, the reordering of premises can change the set of justified
			conclusions. Dialogue logics introduce an adversary, but are like
			belief revision theories in their adherence to deductively consistent
			states of belief.

	<section id="Political_and_judicial_use">
		<h1>Political and Judicial use</h1>
		<p>Many political philosophers have been fond of the word
			indefeasible when referring to rights, e.g., that were inalienable,
			divine, or indubitable. For example, in the 1776 Virginia Declaration
			of Rights, "community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and
			indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish government..." (also
			attributed to James Madison); and John Adams, "The people have a
			right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to
			that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge - I mean of the
			character and conduct of their rulers." Also, Lord Aberdeen:
			"indefeasible right inherent in the British Crown" and Gouverneur
			Morris: "the Basis of our own Constitution is the indefeasible Right
			of the People." Scholarship about Abraham Lincoln often cites these
			passages in the justification of secession. Philosophers who use the
			word defeasible have historically had different world views from
			those who use the word indefeasible (and this distinction has often
			been mirrored by Oxford and Cambridge zeitgeist); hence it is rare to
			find authors who use both words. In judicial opinions, the use of
			defeasible is commonplace. There is however disagreement among legal
			logicians whether defeasible reasoning is central, e.g., in the
			consideration of open texture, precedent, exceptions, and rationales,
			or whether it applies only to explicit defeasance clauses. H.L.A.
			Hart in The Concept of Law gives two famous examples of
			defeasibility: "No vehicles in the park" (except during parades); and
			"Offer, acceptance, and memorandum produce a contract" (except when
			the contract is illegal, the parties are minors, inebriated, or
			incapacitated, etc.).</p>

	<section id="Specificity">
		<h1>Specificity</h1>
		______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
		<p>One of the main disputes among those who produce systems of
			defeasible reasoning is the status of a rule of specificity. In its
			simplest form, it is the same rule as subclass inheritance preempting
			class inheritance:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>(R1) if p then (defeasibly) q e.g.,if penguin then not-flies
				(R2)</li>
			<li>if r then (defeasibly) not-q e.g., if bird then flies(O1)</li>
			<li>if p then (deductively) r e.g., if penguin then bird</li>
			<li>(M1)arguably, p e.g.,arguably, penguin</li>
			<li>(M2) R1 is a more specific reason than R2 e.g.,R1 is better
				than R2</li>
			<li>(M3) therefore, arguably,q e.g., therefore, arguably,
				not-flies</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Approximately half of the systems of defeasible reasoning
			discussed today adopt a rule of specificity, while half expect that
			such preference rules be written explicitly by whoever provides the
			defeasible reasons. For example, Rescher's dialectical system uses
			specificity, as do early systems of multiple inheritance (e.g., David
			Touretzky) and the early argument systems of Donald Nute and of
			Guillermo Simari and Ronald Loui. Defeasible reasoning accounts of
			precedent (stare decisis and case-based reasoning) also make use of
			specificity (e.g., Joseph Raz and the work of Kevin D. Ashley and
			Edwina Rissland). Meanwhile, the argument systems of Henry Prakken
			and Giovanni Sartor, of Bart Verheij and Jaap Hage, and the system of
			Phan Minh Dung do not adopt such a rule.</p>

	<section id="Nature_of_defeasibility">
		<h1>Nature of defeasibility</h1>
		_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-
		<p>
			There is a distinct difference between those who theorize about
			defeasible reasoning as if it were a system of confirmational
			revision (with affinities to belief revision), and those who theorize
			about defeasibility as if it were the result of further
			(non-empirical) investigation. There are at least three kinds of
			further non-empirical investigation: progress in a lexical/syntactic
			process, progress in a computational process, and progress in an
			adversary or legal proceeding. <br> Defeasibility as
			corrigibility: Here, a person learns something new that annuls a
			prior inference. In this case, defeasible reasoning provides a
			constructive mechanism for belief revision, like a truth maintenance
			system as envisioned by Jon Doyle. <br> Defeasibility as
			shorthand for preconditions: Here, the author of a set of rules or
			legislative code is writing rules with exceptions. Sometimes a set of
			defeasible rules can be rewritten, with more cogency, with explicit
			(local) pre-conditions instead of (non-local) competing rules. Many
			non-monotonic systems with fixed-point or preferential semantics fit
			this view. However, sometimes the rules govern a process of argument
			(the last view on this list), so that they cannot be re-compiled into
			a set of deductive rules lest they lose their force in situations
			with incomplete knowledge or incomplete derivation of preconditions.<br>

			Defeasibility as an anytime algorithm: Here, it is assumed that
			calculating arguments takes time, and at any given time, based on a
			subset of the potentially constructible arguments, a conclusion is
			defeasibly justified. Isaac Levi has protested against this kind of
			defeasibility, but it is well-suited to the heuristic projects of,
			for example, Herbert A. Simon. On this view, the best move so far in
			a chess-playing program's analysis at a particular depth is a
			defeasibly justified conclusion. This interpretation works with
			either the prior or the next semantical view. <br> Defeasibility
			as a means of controlling an investigative or social process: Here,
			justification is the result of the right kind of procedure (e.g., a
			fair and efficient hearing), and defeasible reasoning provides
			impetus for pro and con responses to each other. Defeasibility has to
			do with the alternation of verdict as locutions are made and cases
			presented, not the changing of a mind with respect to new (empirical)
			discovery. Under this view, defeasible reasoning and defeasible
			argumentation refer to the same phenomenon.
